Game Description: 
This is a game of matching cards designed with African art. The game starts with a grid of cards face down. To reveal a card, click on it. If you reveal two matching cards, they will stay revealed. If you reveal two unmatched cards, they will flip back over. The goal of the game is to reveal all of the matching pairs of cards. If you match a set of cards you get 1 point. The maximum number of points you can get is 6 points. Once you match all the cards, you refresh the page to play again.

This is how the game is first displayed at rest. To start playing, click on a card (one of the green boxes). In order to match, click on another card to confirm the image.

This is what it looks like when a player successfully matches cards. The scoreboard increases every match they get.

Technology Used:

HTML: I used HTML to create the basic display of the game. 

CSS: I used CSS to style the game, changing the font sizes and colors of the text, and giving the game a light green background and headers a white background. 

JavaScript: I implemented the game's functionality in JavaScript.

Next Steps:
There are some functionalities I would like to add to this game. First, I would like to add a timer to the game and require each player to match within a specific time frame. I think it will create a sense of urgency and excitement. Second, I would like to add an alert that pops up everytime a match happens. For example "congrats, you matahced!"
